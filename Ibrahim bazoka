        "A _statistical hypothesis_ is a conjecture about the distributions of one or more measured variables. It might, for instance, be an assertion about the mean of a distribution, or about the equivalence of the variances of two different distributions. We distinguish between _simple_ hypotheses, for which the distributions are completely specified, for example: _the mean of a normal distribution with  variance $\\sigma^2$  is  $\\mu=0$_, and _composite_ hypotheses, for which this is not the case, e.g., _the mean is $\\mu\\ge 0$_.\n",

To distinguish these from the original assertions, the latter are traditionally called _null_ hypotheses. Thus we might be interested in testing the simple null hypothesis $\\mu = 0$ against the composite alternative hypothesis $\\mu\\ne 0$. An appropriate combination of measurements for deciding whether or not to reject the null hypothesis in favor of its alternative is referred to as a _test statistic_, often denoted by the symbol $Q$. An appropriate _test procedure_ will partition the possible test statistics into two subsets: an acceptance region for the null hypothesis and a rejection region.

It is generally the case that the lower the value of $\\alpha$, the higher is the probability $\\beta$ of making a second kind error, so there is always a trade-off. (Judge Roy Bean, from the film of the same name, didn't believe in trade-offs. He hanged all defendants regardless of the evidence. His $\\beta$ was zero, but his $\\alpha$ was rather large.)\n",

        "So the P values of no-change measurements are uniformly distributed over $[0, 1]$ (the excess of small _P_ values at the left can be ascribed to genuine changes within the polygon). A large _P_ value is no more indicative of no change than a small one. Of course it has to be this way. When, for example, we set a significance level of 5%, then the fraction of false positives, i.e., the fraction of _P_ values smaller than 0.05 given $H_0$, must also be 5%. This accounts for the noisy appearance of the _P_ value image in the no-change regions."

        "#### Change direction: the Loewner order\n",
        "What about the direction of change in the bivariate case? This is less clear, as we can have the situation where the VV intensity gets larger and the VH smaller from time $t_1$ to $t_2$, or vice versa. When we are dealing with the C2 covariance matrix representation of SAR imagery, see Eq. (2.13), a characterization of change can be made as follows [(Nielsen et al. (2019))](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8736751): For each significantly changed pixel, we determine the difference $C2_{t_2}-C2_{t_1}$ and examine its so-called _definiteness_, also known as the _Loewner order_ of the change. A matrix is said to be _positive definite_ if all of its eigenvalues are positive, _negative definite_ if they are all negative, otherwise _indefinite_. In the case of the $2\\times 2$ diagonal matrices that we are concerned with the eigenvalues are just the two diagonal elements themselves, so determining the Loewner order is trivial. For full $2\\times 2$ dual pol or $3\\times 3$ quad pol SAR imagery, devising an efficient way to determine the Loewner order is more difficult, see [Nielsen (2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8913617).\n",

The beauty of GEE is that it is trivially easy to gather arbitrarily long time series of S1 images from the archive, all with revisit times of 6 or 12 days depending on whether one or both satellites are collecting data. The next part of the Tutorial will generalize the techniques we have learned so far to treat multitemporal change detection.\n",

To go from the monovariate LRT to the bivariate LRT, we simply replace the product of  intensities $s_1s_2$ by the product of determinants $|c_1||c_2|$, the sum $s_1+s_2$ by $|c_1+c_2|$ and the factor $2^{2}$ by $2^4=2^{2\\cdot2}$. This observation will come in handy in Part 3."
