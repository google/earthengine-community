# Earth Engine Dataset Search Agent

## Overview

Our mission at Science AI, Google Research, is to enable scientific breakthroughs and discoveries that benefit humanity and radically accelerate scientific progress. One key focus area for us is empowering geospatial analysts and scientists through the power of generative AI and large language models (LLMs). Our aim is to leverage LLMs to assist with planning and code generation in geospatial analysis, dramatically accelerating analyst workflows. 

An important part of automating geospatial workflows is identifying which datasets are most relevant given specific geospatial queries. As such, our initial focus has been to build a dataset search agent to help users find the datasets that are most suitable for their analysis needs. Now more than ever, geospatial analysis and environmental insights are crucial to addressing the risks of climate change, and we hope that empowering analysts to more easily find the right information will have a positive impact on building towards a more sustainable future.

We're excited to release this experimental dataset search agent to the Earth Engine community, and hope it proves valuable for your geospatial analysis needs.  We welcome your feedback, suggestions, and questions at scienceai_ee_dataset_search_agent@googlegroups.com. We would like this tool to grow and evolve with community involvement, so we encourage you to explore, experiment, and build upon it.  We'd love to hear how you're using the agent and any improvements you've made!

## Attribution 

The Earth Engine Dataset Search Agent was developed by the Science AI team in Google Research. The primary developers are Renee Johnston and Eliot Cowan, with design input from Grace Joseph. This notebook was built on the work of Simon Ilyushchenko. The team is also very grateful to our expert advisors, Jeffrey Cardille, Erin Trochim, Morgan Crowley, and Samapriya Roy, for their advice and continued collaboration.
