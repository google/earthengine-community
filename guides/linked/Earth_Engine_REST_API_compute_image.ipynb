This guide shows how to prototype a computation with one of the client libraries, serialize the computation graph and use the REST API to obtain the computed result.  Making compute requests through the REST API corresponds to a `POST` request to one of the compute endpoints, for example [`computePixels`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1beta/projects.image/computePixels), [`computeFeatures`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1beta/projects.table/computeFeatures), or the generic [`value.compute`](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/reference/rest/v1beta/projects.value/compute).
