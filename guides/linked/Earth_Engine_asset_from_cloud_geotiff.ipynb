This notebook demonstrates how to create Earth Engine assets backed by COGs.  An advantage of COG-backed assets is that the spatial and metadata fields of the image will be indexed at asset creation time, making the image more performant in collections.  (In contrast, an image created through `ee.Image.loadGeoTIFF` and put into a collection will require a read of the GeoTiff for filtering operations on the collection.)  The performance of COG-backed assets is comparable to that of ingested assets in typical use cases.\n",

        "The ACLs of COG-backed Earth Engine assets and the underlying data are managed separately. If a COG-backed asset is shared in Earth Engine, it is the owner's responsibility to ensure that the data in GCS is shared with the same parties.

Each URI associated with that entry can have a generation.  See the [object versioning docs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning) for details on generations.  If a generation is specified, for example `gs://foo/bar#123`, Earth Engine will store that URI verbatim.  If a generation is not specified, Earth Engine will store that URI with the generation of the TIFF at the time `ImportExternalImage` was called.\n",
