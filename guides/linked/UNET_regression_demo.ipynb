The key step is sampling the array image at points, to get all the pixels in a 256x256 neighborhood at each point.  It's worth noting that to build the training and testing data for the FCNN, you export a single TFRecord file that contains patches of pixel values in each record.  You do NOT need to export each training/testing patch to a different image.  Since each record potentially contains a lot of data (especially with big patches or many input bands), some manual sharding of the computation is necessary to avoid the `computed value too large` error.

In terms of the shape, the model is trained on 256x256 patches, but can work (in theory) on any patch that's big enough with even dimensions ([reference](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Long_Fully_Convolutional_Networks_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf)).  Because of tile boundary artifacts, give the model slightly larger patches for prediction, then clip out the middle 256x256 patch.  This is controlled with a kernel buffer, half the size of which will extend beyond the kernel buffer.  For example, specifying a 128x128 kernel will append 64 pixels on each side of the patch, to ensure that the pixels in the output are taken from inputs completely covered by the kernel."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FPANwc7B1-TS","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Output assets folder: YOUR FOLDER\n","user_folder = 'users/username' # INSERT YOUR FOLDER HERE.\n","\n","# Base file name to use for TFRecord files and assets.\n","bj_image_base = 'FCNN_demo_beijing_384_'\n","# Half this will extend on the sides of each patch.\n","bj_kernel_buffer = [128, 128]\n","# Beijing\n","bj_region = ee.Geometry.Polygon(\n","        [[[115.9662455210937, 40.121362012835235],\n","          [115.9662455210937, 39.64293313749715],\n","          [117.01818643906245, 39.64293313749715],\n","          [117.01818643906245, 40.121362012835235]]], None, False)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"lLNEOLkXWvSi","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Run the export.\n","doExport(bj_image_base, bj_kernel_buffer, bj_region)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"KxACnxKFrQ_J","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["# Run the prediction.\n","doPrediction(bj_image_base, user_folder, bj_kernel_buffer, bj_region)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"uj_G9OZ1xH6K","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Display the output\n","\n","One the data has been exported, the model has made predictions and the predictions have been written to a file, and the image imported to Earth Engine, it's possible to display the resultant Earth Engine asset.
