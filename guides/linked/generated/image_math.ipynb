    "Observe that the first argument to `expression()` is the textual representation of the math operation, the second argument is a dictionary where the keys are variable names used in the expression and the values are the image bands to which the variables should be mapped. Bands in the image may be referred to as `b(\"band name\")` or `b(index)`, for example `b(0)`, instead of providing the dictionary. Bands can be defined from images other than the input when using the band map dictionary. Note that `expression()` uses \"floor division\", which discards the remainder and returns an integer when two integers are divided. For example `10 / 20 = 0`. To change this behavior, multiply one of the operands by `1.0`: `10 * 1.0 / 20 = 0.5`.
