    "  * Map zoom level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Take special note of scale determined by Map zoom level. Results of object-based methods will vary when viewing or inspecting image layers in the Map, as each pyramid layer has a different scale. To force a desired scale of analysis in Map exploration, use `reproject()`. However, it is strongly recommended that you **NOT** use `reproject()` because the entire area visible in the Map will be requested at the set scale and projection. At large extents this can cause too much data to be requested, often triggering errors. Within the image pyramid-based architecture of Earth Engine, scale and projection need only be set for operations that provide `scale` and `crs` as parameters. See [Scale of Analysis](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/scale#scale-of-analysis) and [Reprojecting](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/projections#reprojecting) for more information."
