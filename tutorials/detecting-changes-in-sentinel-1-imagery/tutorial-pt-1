Single and multi-look image statistics\n","\n","Author: mortcanty\n","\n","Issue #210\n","\n","In this tutorial we will analyze Sentinel-1 imagery archived on the GEE in order to detect statistically significant changes over time. As the adverb \"statistically\" hints, we will need a basic understanding of the statistical properties of SAR imagery in order to proceed, and the adjective \"significant\" implies that we  learn the fundamentals of hypothesis testing. In particular we will be concerned with the dual polarimetric intensity images in the GEE archive. The tutorial is in three parts:\n","\n","- 1. Single and multi-look image statistics\n","- 2. Hypothesis testing for change detection\n","- 3. Applications\n","\n","## Context\n","\n","The Sentinel-1 missions of the ESA provide a fantastic source of weather-independent Earth observation data with repeat times of the order of 6 days. The Google Earth Engine team monitor and ingest the imagery data virtually as fast as they are produced, thus removing the burden from the user of searching, pre-processing and georeferencing. The JavaScript and Python API's to the GEE can then be easily programmed to analyze time series of Sentinel-1 acquisitions virtually anywhere on the globe. Detected changes, both short- and long-term can be related to landscape dynamics and human activity.\n","\n","## Prerequisites\n","\n","We will take a relaxed view of statistical formalism, assuming that the reader has, at minimum, an intuitive understanding of the mean and variance of independent measurements of a quantity $x$,\n","\n","$$\n","{\\rm mean}(x) = {1\\over n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n","$$\n","$$\n","{\\rm var}(x) = {1\\over n}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-{\\rm mean}(x))^2\n","$$\n","\n","and that the measurements can be described by  probability density distribution\n","\n","$$\n","p(x), \\quad -\\infty < x < \\infty, \\quad \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty p(x)dx = 1.\n","$$\n","\n","A very much recommended reference is [Freund's Mathematical Statistics](https://www.amazon.de/John-Freunds-Mathematical-Statistics/dp/013123613X/ref=sr_1_8?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=freund+mathematical+statistics&qid=1597837319&sr=8-8).\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"U7i55vr_aKCB","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Run me first\n","\n","Run the following cell to initialize the API.

look complex (SLC) SAR statistics\n","The Sentinel-1 platform is a dual polarimteric SAR sensor system, emitting one polarization (vertical in most cases) and recording both vertical and horizontal reflected polarizations. This is represented mathematically as\n","\n","$$\n","\\pmatrix{E_v^b\\cr E_h^b} = {e^{-{\\bf i}rk}\\over r}\\pmatrix{S_{vv} & S_{vh}\\cr S_{hv} & S_{hh}}\\pmatrix{E_v^i\\cr 0}. \\tag{1.2}\n","$$\n","\n","The incident vertically polarized radar signal $\\pmatrix{E_v^i\\cr 0}$ is transformed by a complex _scattereing matrix_ $\\pmatrix{S_{vv} & S_{vh}\\cr S_{hv} & S_{hh}}$ into the backscattered signal $\\pmatrix{E_v^b\\cr E_h^b}$ having both vertical and horizontal polarization components. The exponent accounts for the phase shift due to the return distance $r$ from target to sensor, with wave number $k=2\\pi/\\lambda$. From measurement of the backscattered radiation at the sensor, two of the four complex scattering matrix elements can be derived. Written as a  vector, they are:\n"," \n","$$\n","S = \\pmatrix{S_{vv}\\cr S_{vh}}.          \\tag{1.3}\n","$$\n","\n","We write the complex transpose of the vector $S$ as $S^\\dagger = (S_{vv}^*\\ S_{vh}^*)$, where the $*$ denotes complex conjugation. The inner product of $S$ with itself is the total received power (also referred to as the _span_ image)\n","\n","$$\n","P2 = S^\\dagger S = (S_{vv}^*\\ S_{vh}^*)\\pmatrix{S_{vv}\\cr S_{vh}} = |S_{vv}|^2 + |S_{vh}|^2 \\tag{1.4}\n","$$\n","\n","and the outer product is the (dual pol) _covariance matrix image_\n","\n","$$\n","C2 = SS^\\dagger = \\pmatrix{S_{vv}\\cr S_{vh}}(S_{vv}^*\\ S_{vh}^*) = \\pmatrix{|S_{vv}|^2 & S_{vv}^*S_{vh} \\cr S_{vh}^*S_{vv} & |S_{vh}|^2}. \\tag{1.5}\n","$$\n","\n","The diagonal elements are real numbers, the off-diagonal elements are complex conjugates of eachother and contain the relative phases of the $S_{vv}$ and $S_{vh}$ components. The off-diagonal elements are not available for S1 archived imagery on the GEE, so that if we nevertheless choose to represent the data in covariance matrix form, the matrix is diagonal: \n","\n","$$\n","C2 = \\pmatrix{|S_{vv}|^2 & 0 \\cr 0 & |S_{vh}|^2}. \\tag{1.6}\n","$$\n","\n","#### Speckle\n","\n","The most striking characteristic of SAR images, when compared to their visual/infrared\n","counterparts, is the disconcerting _speckle_ effect which makes visual interpretation very\n","difficult. Speckle gives the appearance of random noise, but\n","it is actually a deterministic consequence of the coherent nature of the radar signal.\n","\n","For single polarization transmission and reception, e.g., vertical-vertical ($vv$), the received SLC signal can be modelled in the form\n","\n","$$\n","S_{vv} = {|S^a_{vv}|\\over\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{k=1}^n e^{{\\bf i}\\phi_k}, \\tag{1.7}\n","$$\n","\n","where $|S^a_{vv}|$ is the overall amplitude characterizing the signal scattered from the  area covered by a single pixel, e.g., $10\\times 10\\ m^2$ for our S1 data,  with the phase set equal to zero for convenience. The effects of randomly distributed scatterers within the irradiated area, with dimensions  of the order of the incident wavelength (for C-band approx. 8 cm), add coherently and introduce a change in phase of the  received signal as indicated in the above equation. This effect varies from pixel to pixel and gives rise to _speckle_ in the intensities $|S_{vv}|^2$ that we actually work with when we analyze a Sentinel-1 VV band. \n","\n","If we expand Eq. (1.7) into its real and imaginary parts, we can understand it better:\n","\n","$$\n","S_{vv} = {|S^a_{vv}|\\over\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{k=1}^n e^{{\\bf i}\\phi_k} = {|S^a_{vv}|\\over\\sqrt{n}}\\left(\\sum_k\\cos\\phi_k + {\\bf i}\\sum_k\\sin\\phi_k\\right) =  {|S^a_{vv}|\\over\\sqrt{n}}(x + {\\bf i}y) \\tag{1.8}\n","$$\n","\n","Because the phase shifts $\\phi_k$ are randomly and uniformly distributed, the variables $x$ and $y$ are sums of identically distributed cosine and sine terms respectively. The Central Limit Theorem of statistics then says that $x$ and $y$ will have a normal distribution with zero mean and variance $\\sigma^2 =n/2$ in the limit of large $n$.

The spatial resolution attainable with SAR satellite platforms  involves, among many other considerations, a compromise between azimuthal resolution and swath width, see https://elib.dlr.de/82313/ for a good discussion. In the Sentinel-1 _Interferometric Wide Swath_ acquisition mode, the pixels are about 20m $\\times$ 4m (azimuth $\\times$ range) in extent and the swath widths are about 250km. In the multi-looking procedure, five cells are incoherently averaged in the range direction to achieve $20m \\times 20m$ resolution. (Pixels ingested into the GEE are resampled to $10m\\times 10m$.) The averaging process, which we can symbolize using angular brackets as $\\langle |S_{vv}|^2 \\rangle$ or $\\langle |S_{vh}|^2 \\rangle$, has the desirable effect of reducing speckle (at the cost of range resolution) in the intensity images. We can see this as follows, first quoting a well-known Theorem in statistics:\n","\n","   - If the quantities $s_i,\\ i=1\\dots m,$ are independent and each have exponential distributions given by Eq.

The look-averaged image is\n","\n","$$\n","\\langle s\\rangle = {1\\over m}\\sum_{i=1}^m s_i \\tag{1.16}\n","$$\n","\n","and its mean value is\n","\n","$$\n","{\\rm mean}(\\langle s\\rangle) = {1\\over m}\\sum_{i=1}^m {\\rm mean}(s_i) = {1\\over m}\\sum_{i=1}^m a = a. \\tag{1.17}\n","$$\n","\n","Now we see that the histogram of the Sentinel-1 multi-look image $\\langle s\\rangle =\\langle |S_{vv}|^2 \\rangle$ that we generated above must follow a gamma distribution with the parameters \n","\n","$$\n","\\alpha=m,\\quad \\beta' = {a\\over m} = {{\\rm mean}(\\langle s\\rangle)\\over m}, \\tag{1..18}\n","$$\n","\n","as we demonstrated.\n","\n","The variance of $\\langle s\\rangle$ is given by\n","\n","$$\n","{\\rm var}(\\langle s\\rangle) = {1\\over m^2}{\\rm var}(\\sum_{i=1}^m s_i)= {1\\over m^2}ma^2 = {a^2\\over m}. \\tag{1.19}\n","$$\n","\n","where we have used the fact that the variance of the gamma distribution is $\\alpha\\beta'^2=ma^2$.\n","\n","In practice, the neighborhood pixel intensities contributing to the look average will not be completely independent, but correlated to some extent.
