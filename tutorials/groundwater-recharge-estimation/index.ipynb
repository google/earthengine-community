        "# Implementation of the Thornthwaite-Mather procedure to map groundwater recharge\n",
        "Author: guiattard\n",
        "\n",
        "Groundwater recharge represents the amount of water coming from precipitation reaching the groundwater table. Its determination helps to better understand the available/renewable groundwater in watersheds and the shape of groundwater flow systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the simplest methods to estimate groundwater recharge is the Thornthwaite-Mather procedure (Steenhuis and Van Der Molen, 1986). This procedure was published by Thornthwaite and Mather (1955, 1957). The idea of this procedure is to calculate the water balance in the root zone of the soil where water can be (1) evaporated into the atmosphere under the effect of heat, (2) transpired by vegetation, (3) stored by the soil, and eventually (4) infiltrated when stored water exceeds the field capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "This procedures relies on several parameters and variables described as follows:\n",
        "- information about soil texture (e.g. sand and clay content) to describe the hydraulic properties of the soil and its capacity to store/infiltrate,\n",
        "- meteorological records: precipitation and potential evapotranspiration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course groundwater recharge can be influenced by many other factors such as the slope of the terrain, the snow cover, the variability of the crop/land cover and the irrigation. In the following these aspects are not taken into account.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the first part of the tutorial, the Earth Engine python API will be initialized, some useful libraries will be imported, and the location/period of interest will be defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the second part, [OpenLandMap datasets](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/tags/opengeohub) related to soil properties will be explored. The wilting point and field capacity of the soil will be calculated by applying some mathematical expressions to multiple images.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the third part, [evapotranspiration](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_006_MOD16A2) and [precipitation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/UCSB-CHG_CHIRPS_DAILY) datasets will be imported. A function will be defined to resample the time resolution of an `ee.ImageCollection` and to homogenize time index of both datasets. Both datasets will then be combined into one.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the fourth and final part, the Thornthwaite-Mather(TM) procedure will be implemented by iterating over the meteorological `ee.ImageCollection`. Finally, a comparison between groundwater recharge in two places will be described and the resulting mean annual groundwater recharge will be displayed over France."

This issue is partially addressed by the dataset resampling procedure, but missing value can still exist and this point must be checked before considering that the calculated recharge is representative and reliable."
