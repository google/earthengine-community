        "Histogram matching is a quick and easy way to \"calibrate\" one image to match another. In mathematical terms, it's the process of transforming one image so that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of values in each band matches the CDF of bands in another image.\n",

Below is what it looks like with the SkySat image overlaid on top of the Landsat data, before the matching. Each image's histogram is shown as well:\n",

It's not important to generate that histogram with a really high fidelity, so the `maxPixels` argument is set to use less than \"4 tiles\" of data (256 \\* 256 \\* 4) and `bestEffort` is turned on, to make the computation run fast. When these arguments are set this way, the `reduceRegion()` function will try to figure out how many pixels it would need to process at the given scale, and if that's greater than the `maxPixels` value, it computes a lower scale to keep the total number of pixels below `maxPixels`.
