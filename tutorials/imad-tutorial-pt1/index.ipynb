        "\n",
        "With the great tools available in Google Earth Engine (GEE) it is easy to generate satellite image differences and time series animations which visualize changes on the Earth surface, sometimes quite dramatically. Such representations are very good as eye-openers to give a conceptual, overall impression of change. They may, however, be perceived differently from person to person and not allow more than subjective interpretation. With more objective and rigorous statistical methods one can often extract more and better change information on both pixel and patch/field levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD) transformation was proposed and developed some time ago by [Allan Nielsen and his coworkers](https://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/pubs/1220-full.html) at the Technical University of Denmark and later [extended to an iteratively re-weighted version](https://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/pubs/4695-full.html) called IR-MAD or iMAD. The iMAD algorithm has since found widespread application for the generation of change information from visual/infrared imagery as well as for performing [relative radiometric normalization](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/pubs/5362-full.html) of image pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is intended to familiarize GEE users with the iMAD method so that they may use it with confidence in their research wherever they think it might be appropriate. It is based on material taken from Chapter 9 of [Canty (2019)](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/image-analysis-classification-change-detection-remote-sensing-morton-john-canty/10.1201/9780429464348).

This sounds at first counter-intuitive: Why make the images similar when we want to see the dissimilarities? The crux is that, in making them match one another by taking suitable linear combinations, we ensure that pixels in the transformed images $U$ and $V$ at which *indeed no change has taken place* will be as similar as possible before they are compared (subtracted). The genuine changes will then, it is hoped, be all the more apparent in the difference image.\n",
