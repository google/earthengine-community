It combines a series of technologies, each best suited to a particular task in the data reduction process. **Earth Engine** is used to access, clean, and reduce large amounts of spatiotemporal data, **pandas** is used to analyze and organize the results, and **Altair** is used to visualize the results.\n",

        "**Note**: This notebook demonstrates an analysis template and interactive workflow that is appropriate for a certain size of dataset, but there are limitations to interactive computation time and server-to-client data transfer size imposed by Colab and Earth Engine. To analyze even larger datasets, you may need to modify the workflow to [export](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install#exporting-data) `FeatureCollection` results from Earth Engine as static assets and then use the static assets to perform the subsequent steps involving Earth Engine table formatting, conversion to pandas DataFrame, and charting with Altair."

Within the context of the entire time series, it is apparent that the decline is outside of normal inter-annual variability and that the reduction in NBR for this site is quite severe. The lack of major recovery response in NBR in 2017-19 (time of writing) indicates that the event was not ephemeral; the loss of vegetation will have a lasting impact on this site. The corresponding onset of drought and reduction in NBR provides further evidence that there is a relationship between drought and vegetation response in the Sierra Nevada ecoregion."
